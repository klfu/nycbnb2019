current choropleth map just shows where all airbnb locations in csv are at 
and the respective avg price by zip code

in order for map to show entirety of NYC, need to upload csv of lat/long boundaries by
zip code and use that as 'df' instead of airbnb locations csv

afterwards, will then need to bring in average airbnb lodging prices by zip into 'df',
and then can use plotly.express to map out and color by avg price
