for nyc_bnb.py:

current choropleth map just shows where all airbnb locations in csv are at 
and the respective avg price by zip code

in order for map to show entirety of NYC, need to upload csv of lat/long boundaries by
zip code and use that as 'df' instead of airbnb locations csv

afterwards, will then need to bring in average airbnb lodging prices by zip into 'df',
and then can use plotly.express to map out and color by avg price

However, when replacing geojson from pluto_ziponly.geojson (PLUTO data downloader) with
nyczipcodetabulationareas.geojson (nyc community portal) and running .py file,
choropleth map showed fully instead of the scattered dots when using pluto_ziponly???

probably an issue with pluto_ziponly geojson, where in order for map to display correctly,
needed to create the choropleth map thru referencing bbl (lot codes) instead of by zip;
polygon coordinates mapped for individual lots rather than for zip whereas the other
geojson file coordinates were mapped specifically for zip
